# Bash Scripting 

Bash scripting is the process of writing scripts in the Bash (Bourne Again SHell) language, which is a Unix shell and command language used in many Linux distributions and macOS. Bash scripts are essentially a series of commands that can be executed in sequence, allowing you to automate tasks, perform system administration, and carry out various tasks on your computer.
